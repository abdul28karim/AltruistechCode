Altruistech Environmental Compliance Guage project offers a product and service that empowers organizations and industries to monitor and improve their environmental compliance levels effectively. We provide a comprehensive solution that combines hardware, software, and data analytics to promote environmental compliance. The core product is an Arduino robotic car with a user-friendly data collection, analysis, and compliance monitoring interface. This robot comprises data collection sensors, such as noise pollution monitors, MQ135 sensors, NDIR CO2 sensors, and waste management trackers, deployed within organizations to collect real-time environmental data. Additionally, the project integrates beaming light technology to display compliance levels using color profiles visually.
